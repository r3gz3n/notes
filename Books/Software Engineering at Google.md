## Chapter 1 - What is Software Engineering

### Programming vs Software Engineering

- Three differences between programming and software engineering: Time, Scale and Trade-offs at play.
  - Time:
    - To see impact of time on a program, ask “What is the expected life span of your code?”.
    - Sustainability\_ is, for the expected life span, capability of reacting to the valuable changes comes along, for either technical or business reasons.
  - Scale:
    - Programming is an act of individual creation, but software engineering is a team effort.
  - Trade-offs:
    - The complexity of decisions that need to be made and their stakes.

### Time and Change

Fig 1: Life Span and the importance of upgrades

- Transition, from low to high, happens somewhere between one-off program and project that lasts for decades
- Transitions can be painful for three reasons:
  - Upgrades has not been done before, therefore have more hidden assumptions.
  - Engineers are less likely to have experience in this sort of task.
  - Size of upgrade is larger than usual.
- Transition depends on cost of upgrade, value it provides and expected life span of project.
